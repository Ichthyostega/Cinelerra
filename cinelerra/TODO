Big bugs
----------------
Node framerates not displaying.
Drag effect before timeline is finished drawing after a load -> lockup
Quicktime mp3 needs standards check
Importing assets of the same name but different resolutions crashes because the
formats aren't updated.
Default pan keyframe gets pasted when dragging edit from one track to another.
Undo doesn't restore project title from previous load.
 - New file can be saved under old filename if undo is used.
 - Current title changes in save function and could not be restored in redo.
Load a sound file.  Change the file on the disk.  Crash on exit.
Batch filename not saved from recording dialog if cancelled.

Big Features
----------------
undo menu showing previous 20 steps to undo
Picons instead of pulldown menu for load dialog.
Common service for audio and video drivers.
Documentation:
 - recording interface
 - section on creating a new project in which channels are described
 - Channels must be encoded as C, FL, FR, BL, BR, LFE for MPEG-4 audio and AC3.

Digital TV
	- make tuner part of executable and access through render client
	- combined tuner driver
	- automatic scan with selection of first video and audio PID's
	- user selects PID's in the channel edit dialog
	- available PID's are updated in realtime
	- software preview of video and audio.  Maybe decoded in the record driver.

CHANNELS

The number of channels Cinelerra should set the device for.  Regardless
of the number of channels in the project, the number of channels set
here will be written to the device.  When this is set to 2 and the
project has 1 channel you'll hear sound through the left speaker and
not centered as expected for a monaural project.  When this is set to 1
and the project has 2 channels you'll hear the left channel centered
and not 2 channels mixed together.

CHANNELS

The number of channels Cinelerra should set the device for.  Regardless
of the number of channels in the record operation, the number of
channels set here will be read from the device.  When this is set to 2
and the record operation has 1 channel you'll record the left speaker
and not a mix of the left and right speakers as expected for a monaural
project.  When this is set to 1 and the project has 2 channels you'll
record the left and right channels mixed into the left speaker and not
1 channel spead across two speakers.
