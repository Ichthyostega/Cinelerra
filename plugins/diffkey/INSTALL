=======================================
Installation instructions for DiffKey

-----------------------------------
Installing the precompiled binary


You may be able to use DiffKey by simply copying the file "diffkey.plugin" to
your Cinelerra plugins directory.  On my system, this is "/usr/lib/cinelerra/",
so the command would be:

  cp diffkey.plugin /usr/lib/cinelerra/

If you don't have "/usr/lib/cinelerra/", you might try to find it with one of
the following commands:

  slocate oil.plugin

  or

  find /usr -name oil.plugin

Once you've moved the plugin into the appropriate directory, it should show up
in the plugin list the next time you start Cinelerra.  If not, you'll probably
have to recompile DiffKey yourself.


------------------------
Building from source


To do this, you'll need to have the Cinelerra source code.  Once you have
untarred the source, edit the diffkey Makefile, and change the "CINELERRA_DIR="
line so that it points to your copy of the source code.  After this, you should
be able to use:

  make

  make install

  (Note that you may have to use "su" to become root before executing "make
  install".)
