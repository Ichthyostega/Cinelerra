hvirtual (1:1.1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Patch me if you can" release
  * Applied patches:
    loop (Andraz Tori <Andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>):
      fixes a problem wehere audio position was reported
    	completely wrong and cursor went temporarily nuts while playing in
    	loop, which was	annoying the other thing it does is that it aligns
    	cursor on frames while playing (if that option is set)
    titler-charsets (Andraz Tori <Andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>):
      enables non-english users to use their own charsets
  		in the titler plugin.
   * Includes now mplexlo and mplexhi.
   * Re-includes the badly forgotten mpeg2enc (really sorry for this one)
