Things needing to get fixed regarding translations:

- in performanceprefs.C fix titles static array so it will be translatable
- same in recordgui.C
- same in timeentry.C (day_table)
- same in bcfilebox.C (column_titles)
- fix vdevicebuz.C to be able to handle translated messages
- PROGRAM_NAME constant should be handled differently
